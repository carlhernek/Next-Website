I started the Frontend\r\n          Developer program at Hyper Island in august 2019 and have since been\r\n          hard at work learning the ways of web development, user experience and\r\n          agile working environments.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I started this journey because I found myself becoming gradually more\r\n          interested in the technology side of things in my work. Almost\r\n          everything today has a digital component to it and requires specific\r\n          knowledge in regards to us as humans and technology.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2>Projects</h2>\r\n        <Projects />\r\n        <Pagestyle />\r\n      </div>\r\n    </Container>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
