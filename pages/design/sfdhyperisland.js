          <p>
            Stockholm Fashion District tasked us with improving the experience
            of their website on mobile devices. They requested a more "app-like"
            experience for their users as well as clear user flows through the
            content on their site. They also wished to tailor the experience
            towards the different "sections" of their user base, buyers,
            designers and fabric producers.
          </p>
          <h2 className="h2-styled">User Testing</h2>

            below follows a brief summary of the key learnings from our user
            testing.

              1. Structure & Relevancy of content based on type of visitor and

          <h2 className="h2-styled">My Role</h2>
          <p>
            My main responsibilities in this project was creating content,
            preparing wireframes, overseeing the figma prototyping process and
            designing user flow through the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            The roles were defined together in the group to closely resemble the
            learning goals we each had set to achieve in the project, mine
            specifically was to learn and improve figma workflow.

            The foundation of the Figma workspace was created using the current
            SFD graphic guidelines as a guide as well as some additions due to
            accessibility, such as colors with sufficient contrast.

            Since the module included a segment of design for components, we
            naturally practiced this in our project. This ensures designers and
            developers share the same mindset in the project.

                The first part of the website lets you introduce yourself and
                your main interest to SFD so that they may deliver customized
                content on their frontpage, more relevant to your preferences.

              <p>
                We decided that we did not want to overly complicate the
                experience with a signup/login modal at the beginning and rather
                we opted on a cookie-stored to save time and resources on for
                everyone involved.

                Since the users already liked having promoted content at the
                top, we kept this feature and only made the design more clear
                with a call to action.
              </p>
              <p>
                The articles, promoted events or other relevant content appear

                Last but not least and perhaps the biggest request from SFD. A
                restructuring of the way they display brands.
              </p>
              <p>
                We kept the feature to filter brands after first letter but
                removed the option to see every brand in one huge list. It was
                simply too vast to display on mobile.
              </p>
              <p>
                Users can again opt to sort among brands using sorting tags to
                find function, types or materiel.
